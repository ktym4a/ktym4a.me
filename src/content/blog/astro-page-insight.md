Astro Page Insight is now available.

## What is Astro Page Insight?

[Astro Page Insight](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-page-insight) is an Astro integration that shows everything to improve from Lighthouse results directly on the page.

### Features

1. Show Lighthouse results directly on the page. Highlight the appropriate element with **responsive**.
2. Displays errors in meta tags and console logs.

## Why did I create Astro Page Insight?

I've always been a little uncomfortable with opening `Page Speed Insight` or checking with `DevTool` to see the Lighthouse results, so I've been trying to find a smarter way to do it.

## Roadmap

I want to make it an integrated dev tool for web development.

-   Show lighthouse Score.
-   Addition of filters for Lighthouse results.
-   Analysis and display in meta tag information. (e.g. Open Graph, Twitter Card)
-   Optimize UI/UX.
-   Add caching for Lighthouse results. (for improving DX)
-   Add CI integration.
-   Add feature for PWAs.

## Summary

I am sure this tool will be a game changer for your development experience and Hope you find Astro Page Insight useful.

I'm looking forward to your feedback and suggestions. If you have any questions, please feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ktym4a/astro-page-insight)
